        <p>This game is made for CS 290's final project (Hall of Fame). It is the result of the passion and hard work of our small but dedicated team of four.</p>
        <p>A special shoutout to <strong>Kai Black</strong> for the awesome html and backend support, 
            <strong>Chi Chan</strong> for the fun characters and combat system, 
            <strong>Bessie He</strong> for the stunning maps and scenes design, 
            and <strong>Tan Singsukhum</strong> for the immersive music and storytelling.</p>
        <p>We also wish to acknowledge our early players, whose feedback was invaluable in fine-tuning our game.</P>
        <p>Lastly, we give our greatest thanks to DevWorm from YouTube. His Godot tutorials are awesome and they helped us a lot during the game development. 
            We would also like to thank game asset designers, without your generosity (free online assets), it would be impossbile to have such beautiful graphic.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you everyone! <br>
