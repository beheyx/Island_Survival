	Island Man: You've found me! What brings you here?
	- How can I escape this island?
	ISLAND MAN: The only way to get out of here is that you have to get the key from the monster inside the cave.
	- Where is the cave?
	ISLAND MAN: The cave is near the ancient stone you can find it on the EAST side of this island.
	Island Man: Be caution, for danger hides in the cave.
	Island Man: Good luck!
